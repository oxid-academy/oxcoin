This package contains an example module intended for training purposes at OXID Academy.

# Installation instructions

## Register and require the package

In the local development environment, cd into the root directory of your compilation (where composer.json and composer.lock
are located) and run Composer as shown below:
 
```
composer config repositories.oxid-academy/oxcoin vcs https://github.com/oxid-academy/oxcoin.git
```

This should result in the following change to `composer.json`:
```
  ...
  "repositories": {
    "oxid-academy/oxcoin": {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "https://github.com/oxid-academy/oxcoin.git"
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
```

And then, ...
```
composer require oxid-academy/oxcoin:dev-resolved
```

... which results in something like:
```
  "require": {
    ...,
    "oxid-academy/oxcoin": "dev-resolved"
  },
```

# Enabling the module

```
vendor/bin/oe-console o:m:activate oxacoxcoin
```

# Running tests
